### mac-os:
- Open terminal inside of the same directory you found this README.md file.
- To run the program, type: python main.py
- You will want to expand your terminal window alot and possibly zoom out(cmd -).
- Press Control C to kill the program at any time.

### terminal tips:
Type a command, and then press enter.
- "pwd" will show you which directory you are in now.
- "ls"    will show you all files and directories(folders) in the current directory.
- "cd"    will allow you to move into another directory. 
for example: when you first open terminal it will probably open in the current user's main directory.
If you type   (cd Desktop)    you will move to your Desktop.


### Windows pc:
You can open "cmd prompt" in this directory, and then the python command will be the same.
but better yet I recommend you get "Powershell". "Powershell" allows you to use Unix based
commands(like what is found in mac-os' Terminal and on Linux) which are much more common and easier to work with.



Let me know if you have any questions.
